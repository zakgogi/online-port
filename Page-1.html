            My name is Zak Gogi and I am a Maths graduate from the University of Leeds, I'm currently a Futureproof Trainee Developer. As a Mathematics student I am an excellent problem solver, have good numerical skills, am able to communicate ideas clearly and am a quick learner. I have experience through my degree using Python, and on my own time I’ve learned and used Javascript and HTML/CSS on professional projects. I worked for a while at a tech company called Beauhurst, using their backend software to identify and create profiles for high-growth UK companies.

            In my spare time I’m currently actively investing in the American small cap market, primarily intraday trading with a small but growing account. I’ve attended the CogX convention as a volunteer, and specifically attended talks on blockchain which I have an interest in. I’m currently engaging in different Python projects through CodeAcademy Pro, and I’m looking to expand my coding skills to other languages. Some of these projects included working on developing a chatbot using python and language parsing, creating an endless runner game using unity and c++ for the engine of the game, and things like using python’s pandas library to lay out data on the S&P 500 fund to help identify stocks I’m personally interested in investing in.
